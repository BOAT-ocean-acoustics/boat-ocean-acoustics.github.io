# Welcome to {{hackweek}}!

The Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT) program aims to broaden access to ocean acoustics by empowering learners to explore and advance the field through collaboration and shared knowledge. We focus on:
1) Developing open, executable, and web-hosted tutorials that encapsulate fundamental ocean acoustics knowledge and techniques as living documents.
2) Growing the ocean acoustics education and research community through interactive and collaborative workshops.

## The BOAT philosophy

In BOAT, we **emphasize the development of physical and mathematical intuitions behind equations through hands-on computational examples**, and use interactive "widgets" in executable tutorials to inspire and motivate learners to dive deeper into specific topics of their choice.

Below is an example "widget" in Python that demonstrates how the beampattern of a circular piston transducer changes with sound frequency and aperture radius.

Looking ahead, we envision maintaining a collection of tutorial modules backed by a persistent cloud-hosted computing environment, to a space for the ocean acoustics community to learn and explore collaboratively beyond in-person or virtual workshops.
