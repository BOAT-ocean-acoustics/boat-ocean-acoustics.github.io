# What to Expect 

## Workshop format

We believe in learning by doing and sharing, and design the BOAT workshop to be highly interactive with hands-on tutorials and exercises with real-world data to encourage exchanges and collaboration between workshop participants.


## Computing environment

All workshop tutorials and exercises will be in a browser-based [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) computing environment via [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We will provide a quick walk through in the beginning of the workshop to make sure everyone knows how to navigate this environment and look for help. If you are interested in trying this out ahead of time, [follow this page to try Jupyter on your browser](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html).

## Programming experience

The focus of the workshop will be on ocean acoustics, and the goal of the executable tutorials is to ensure theoretical concepts are introduced alongside **hands-on-keyboard** exercises for participants to develop physical intuitions behind the equations. 

All executable workshop materials are written in Python. Therefore, we expect participants to have some experience with scripting programming languages (e.g., Python, Matlab, and R), and are able to read and write scripts of executable logic, manipulate variables, load libraries and read their documentation to determine their use, and plot graphs. If you are not familiar with Python, complete the introductory [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) lesson prior to the workshop. 

Advanced Python skills are not required for the workshop, but if you are interested in learning more useful Python packages, check out the Project Pythia [Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html).

:::{tip}
The easiest way to access a working notebook environment is via [Google Colab](https://colab.google/), which does not require installing anything on your own machine. However, there may be other hurdles if you need to install many additional packages than what's already provided in Colab by default.

If you are interested in installing Python on your own machine, we recommend using **Miniforge** following the steps [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#python-1).
