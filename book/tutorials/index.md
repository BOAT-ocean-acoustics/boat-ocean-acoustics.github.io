# Tutorial Topics

During the BOAT workshop, we will focus on developing physical intuitions behind the equations for key ocean acoustics concepts. We aim for providing an on-ramp for participants to think about ocean acoustics problems in a holistic manner. Therefore, we designed the tutorials to be interactive and provide materials at a conceptual level with ample hands-on exercises. Participants will also work with real-world ocean acoustics data in small groups in hands-on exercise sessions.

Beyond the workshop, we encourage participants to dive deeper into the physics, math, and signal processing concepts behind each topic. The BOAT team will continue to develop in-depth tutorials on these topics and link them below.

Below are the topics we will cover in the workshop. We will add tutorial recordings and add in-depth materials for self-learning as they become available.
